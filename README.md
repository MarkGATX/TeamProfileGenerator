# Team Profile Generator
A command line application to log the members of a team of employees and pass that data on to an HTML page for use


## The ninth challenge in the UT-Austin Full Stack Development Bootcamp - Create a Team Profile Generator


___


Our introduction to Node.js and object oriented programming culminates in this project. We use modules to write, navigate, and test data that we then use to write to a new HTML page. This is purely a command line interface that uses the Inquirer package as well as Jest, and fs to create a basic HTML page. I also used Bootstrap to keep pushing my familiarity with the framework.

Because this isn't a deployed app, there's not a link to a live site showing it's functionality. Instead you can watch a short video here that shows how it works at its most basic.

## How to use

From the parent folder of the index.js file, call on index.js. Several questions will be sent to the command line asking you for vital information about your development team members.

Each employee has four questions to answer. At the end of those four questions, you'll be asked if you want to add any more employees, either Engineers or Interns. (The assumption here is that there will be one Manager on the team).

When you're finished with the employees on your team, you'll choose 'Finish.' An HTML page will be generated in the `dist` folder. You can open this page to see a graphical, responsive rendering of your team.

## Changes Made and Lessons Learned

- As my first experience dealing with Classes and Subclasses this project, this helped me really grasp the concept of creating them more than the purely abstract concept. This project gave me one of the 'ah ha!' moments that we all hear about when I was constructing my subclasses. 

- I'm continuing to push my familiarity with Bootstrap and it is getting slightly more intuitive with every iteration. I still find myself customizing the CSS and I realize now that if I use version 5.0 then I can theoretically override the default color values and have Bootstrap automatically assign complimentary colors. I will need to learn hpw to use SaSS in order to make that work but if it gives me more freedom with color then it's worth the effort.

- Creating the tests became an issue of me overthinking my problems. I went from trying to create new methods to pull data from the main application without realizing all I needed to do was create testing data independent of the actual application. Life suddenly made more sense.

## Possible Future Changes

- Resize Material Icons on the cards so they show up better.
- Integrate validation on the inquirer prompts.
